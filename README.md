## Goals
### 1. Incorporate the pre-req dataset with the course search algorithm
### 2. Add more filters to make the course search more specific
> a) Incorporate course structure selection in the form of check-boxes instead of the dropdown <br>
> b) Incorporate grading option selection in the form of check-boxes <br>
> c) Course length should be implemented in a more flexible way (selecting time interval) <br>
> d) Incorporate a function to search based on fullfilling certain major requirements 
### 3. Display course description in the search results
### 4. Find a way to evaluate search performance
### 5. Find out why the current search algorithm gives inconsistent results
